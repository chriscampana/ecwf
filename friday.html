On Friday Pandemonium we saw many things. First of all we learned that because Commissioner Clawson is very busy he has handed all control of the ECWF to Christopher Winner! This is a stunning revelation and who knows what will happen to the ECWF! Christopher Winner's first job as interim commissioner was to get back and the people who has defeated him at Hard Time. First, The Assman had to take on The Gateway, one of the new additions to the ECWF. The next match Winner set up was for the ECWF North American Title with Russ Rage vs. Winner himself! Winner wasn't done though. The next match he set up was for The Franchise. He gave the Franchise T squared, a duo of Taylor Watson and Tyler Wakefield, his cousins...or so Winner said. It was later learned that Watson and Wakefield were really Casey Tibbs and The Champ, Winner just made up names to throw off the Franchise. Nevertheless, The Franchise had a handicap match against T Squared! We went to the ring for the first match of the night.
</p><p>
This match was The Gateway vs. The Assman. When we went to the entrance way we were shocked to find out that the special referee in this match would be Christopher Winner. The odds were heavily stacked against the Assman. Assman was on offense for most of the match until The Gateway hit a clothesline. The Gateway decided to gloat will Assman gained his strength. When the Gateway turned back around Assman caught him with a choke-slam and went for the cover. Winner counted 1...2...and promptly gave Assman the double birdie. He then hit Assman with his elbow pad. Gateway and Winner took Assman apart. Winner hit the Tiebreaker on Assman and Gateway hit the Jersey Driver. Gateway covered and Winner counted with a win for Gateway. 
</p><p>
Next we went to the locker room area. Russ Rage was looking for The Franchise. When he found him Christopher Winner was standing over an unconscious The Franchise cutting his hair. Winner hit Rage and ran off. He returned to see an irate Franchise. He told the world that at the next PPV that Christopher Winner was going down.
</p><p>
The next match was for the ECWF North American Title. It was Christopher Winner vs. Russ Rage. Assman was going to get revenge in this one by being the special guest referee. This was a brutal match. Steel chairs were used many times in this match. Finally Rage hit the Off The Rope Demolisher and the Sexy Slam for the pin. After the match the Franchise came out to get revenge on Winner. He power-bombed Winner on two chairs. I don't know how Winner survived.
</p><p>
The next match was the handicap match between T Squared and The Franchise. Christopher Winner recovered and came out to do guest commentary in this one. Casey Tibbs and The Champ were in control for most of this match, with many good double teaming maneuvers. The Franchise somehow got control and reversed one of their moves. He put the Franchiser on both Tibbs and The Champ. After he got the pin the Battle Royal for the ECWF number one contender-ship started. This was a brutal battle royal with chairs, bats, rope, and all sorts of weapons being used. The Franchise himself was forced into fighting this battle royal by Winner. It was a long and hard battle but someone had to win. Finally it was Rage, Winner, and Franchise. The odds were against Winner but, he managed to Winner Slam Rage and eliminate him. He then hit The Franchise with a foreign object and hit the Winner Slam for the win. Winner is going to Only the Strong Survive! </p>

What a Friday Pandemonium we had this week. More debuts of more new wrestlers including Quacker Oats, The Garbage Man, and White Trash Dudley. 
</p><p>
The show started out with a tag team match. It was one half of T Squared, Casey Tibbs, and The Gateway. T-Bone could not participate because of injuries. They would by fighting against the fresh off suspension Victor E. Moore, and the new White Trash Dudley, one of the infamous Dudley Boys in ECW and WWF. Being the friends that they are, Gateway and Casey Tibbs worked well as a team. Victor E. and Dudley did not. The match was controlled by Tibbs and Gateway and finally in the end Gateway hit the Jersey Driver for the 1,2,3. 
</p><p>
The next match would be a rivalry to the extreme as Assman would finally get a shot at Chris Winner. This match went back and forth and they battled all around the arena. Chris Winner tried to whip Assman out of the ring but Assman hit ECWF senior referee Earl Nelson. While the ref was out Assman took control. He had Christopher Winner on the ground and ascended to the top rope. He hit Death From Above on Chris Winner but the ref didn't see it. It was obvious Assman would have gotten the win but know one was there to count. All of the sudden Gateway came in and hit Assman with a chair. Christopher Winner picked Assman up, and delivered the Tiebreaker just as Gateway was getting the ref up. Winner covered for the 1,2,3 and the win.
</p><p>
Next, we had the debuts of Quacker Oats and The Garbage Man. The would be fighting each other, but also be a tag team in the Battle Royal on Only The Strong Survive. This match ended with Garbage Man hitting the Takin' Out The Trash.
</p><p>
Christopher Winner, who has all control over the ECWF because of Commissoner Clawson, set a match for friends Dustin Credible, Russ Rage, and The Franchise, to fight in a Three Way Dance. This was a great exciting match. The Franchise went for a top rope moonsault but missed. While he was on the ground, Credible hit the Centon Bomb, but Franchise kicked out! Rage then hit the Sexy Slam on Credible and Franchise hit the Franchiser and covered him for the 1,2,3.  </p>

          <p>  The show started out with The Franchise coming out. He was mad. He called out the commissioner, JJ Clauson. How could Clauson turn on the Franchise like that? Sledgehammer hits and out comes the Victory Alliance. Winner, Gateway, Credible, Tibbs, and Clauson. Franchise says he doesn't care about the title. He wants Clauson in a match at Underground Revolution. Franchise wants the match to be control of the ECWF. Nobody thought Clauson would accept but he did. With a couple of stipulations. First of all, it is a no DQ match. Second of all it was a gauntlet match meaning Franchise must pin all other members of the Victory Alliance before he gets to Clauson. Franchise agrees and can't wait for UR. Clauson's not done. If he wins then Franchise is fired! Also, later in the night Franchise will fight Credible and Winner in a ladder death match. Oh My God. 
</p><p>
First match is between the Gateway and the Assman. Assman announces before the match that he wants Winner at UR. Winner and Gateway comes out and accepts the match, but it has to be a thumb tack match. Assman says okay and the match starts. Assman hits Death From Above but Winner came in and hit Assman with a frying pan to prevent the pin. Gateway then hit the Jersey Driver but Assman kicked out! He hit a choke-slam off a ladder and covered for the 1,2,3. 
</p><p>
Both Tibbs and Rage are still injured so the ECWF decided to put them in matches against each other. For the ECWF North American Title! Slow match until Assman comes in and helps Rage win. Is there a friendship between Assman and Rage? 
</p><p>
Now it was time for the ladder death match. Winner came out swingin' with a cane and cane'd the Franchise many times. Franchise was down but not out. He knocked Winner into Credible and laid them onto each other. He then executed a perfect five star frog splash off of the ladder. He went for the pin but to no avail. Then Clauson and Gateway came out, the rest of the Victory Alliance. Gateway hit Franchise with a chair and Credible and Winner pinned him at the same time for the win. Then, the Victory Alliance took apart the Franchise as Winner held the Franchise and Clauson repeatedly hit him with a steal chair. We ended the show with a bloody Franchise. </p>

Wow what a pandemonium we had a week before Underground Revolution, headlined by the tack death match between Winner and the Assman for the ECWF title. The show started with Dustin Credible bringing out part of the victory alliance. Out comes Christopher Winner and Commissioner JJ Clauson. Credible tried to talk but Winner took the microphone away. Winner told the newly formed "Eliminators" in the form of The Franchise and Russ Rage that they would have a special match. The commish then told them that he himself would fight with Winner and Credible against the Eliminators. Since they were the eliminators this would be a elimination match which could mean that at any time it could be three on one. Then the eliminators came out and accepted the match but not before Winner hit the Franchise with a microphone and a brawl occurred with the Victory Alliance beating the hell out of the Eliminators. 
</p><p>
Then an interview with the champion was next. Winner reminded Assman of the upcoming tack death match saying that he would Winner Slam him and Tiebreak him onto the tacks and retain his title. Then Winner asked Credible what would happen at Underground Revolution when he defends his belts against T-squared. Credible talked about his Centon-Credibomb heard round the world and said he is not afraid to do it again. He said he would not have a partner and he would not need one. Next, Winner told the Franchise about his gauntlet match at UR. If he wins, he gets a shot at JJ Clauson for control of the ECWF for 90 days. If he should lose in either match, then his ass is fired. Winner says the Franchise will not win. 
</p><p>
Then the self-proclaimed Eliminators got some time to explain what they will do at UR. The Franchise promised that he would win the gauntlet and he would beat JJ Clauson to gain control of the ECWF. Russ Rage guaranteed that the Franchise and himself would eliminate the victory alliance tonight and that the sexy slam would be in full effect. 
</p><p>
The match started with a brief intro of each team. Then the Franchise brought up a good point. Dustin Credible was nowhere to be seen. Then all of a sudden, Credible attacked Rage and Franchise from behind with a steel chain and the match was on. The Victory Alliance gained control in the early going using their one-man advantage; but then out of nowhere, Franchise and Rage hit a 3-D on JJ Clauson and pinned him. The sides were now even. The brawl continued with all weapons imaginable. Credible continuing to use his steel chain and Christopher Winner used a broom. Then, Russ Rage took a cowbell and smashed it into the face of Credible. Then Credible regained control of the match by attacking Rage's still injured ankle. Credible thought he had it in control when he hit Russ Rage with a low blow. This turned out to be a bad mistake. After this move, Russ Rage broke out into a psychotic blur of rage and nailed Credible with a Rage-Spear through a wooden 6-foot ladder. OH MY GOD! Credible was obviously done after that amazing move and now it was Russ Rage and the Franchise against the champion Winner. Just when they were beating the hell out of Winner, the Franchise hit a jumping-DDT off the ladder. This seemed to be it but Credible and the Commish interfered disabling Rage and Winner was able to hit the Tie Breaker on The Franchise for the Win. 
</p><p>
Underground Revolution promises to be a great pay-per view. Nowhere has anyone heard of a Thumbtack Death match. This is definitely the first of its kind in Backyard Wrestling. You won't see this on EBW. Also video for this pandemonium will be up soon.
