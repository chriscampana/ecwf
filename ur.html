       <p>  This was the ECWF's third PPV and looked to be a good one. Dustin Credible, the Tag Me Champion and also ECWF announcer came out and announced the card. There would be of course the four way dance for the ECWF North American Title. This came as a result of T-Bone being kicked out of the ECWF. Next would be the Gauntlet Match with everyone in the Victory Alliance going in against The Franchise. If Franchise pinned all the wrestlers in the Victory Alliance, then he would get a chance to wrestle The Commish, JJ Clauson. If he pinned Clauson then he would control the ECWF for 90 days. If anyone in the Victory Alliance pinned The Franchise, then he would be fired from the ECWF. The last match would be the Thumbtack Death match for the ECWF Title between Assman and Winner. Here comes the first match. 
</p><p>
      The order of appearance for the match was Credible, Gateway, Tibbs, then Russ Rage. The Victory Alliance had stacked the deck in this match against Rage, because if they won the match then they would hold all the belts of the ECWF. The match started off with Gateway and Tibbs fighting as both of them wanted the North American gold, even though they were both members of the Victory Alliance. Rage stood back and let them fight to save his energy for later, as he would need it. Finally Dustin Credible hit the Centon-Credibomb on Gateway for the 1, 2, 3 and now there were three fighters. All three were fighting and all the sudden Russ Rage hit the patented Sexy Slam for the 1, 2, 3 on Credible. Tibbs saw an opening and struck as he Clotheslined Rage threw a ladder. Rage was out and Tibbs covered and won the ECWF North American Champion. The Victory Alliance came out to what appeared to be a celebration but they attack Casey Tibbs!!! Casey Tibbs, The Champ, was down and out. Why would the Victory Alliance kick him out of the Alliance if he had just won the NA Title?
</p><p>
      The next match was the Gauntlet Match. What was weird about the start of this match was there was still no appearance by The Commish. Did he plan on not even being there? Gateway came out first for the V.A. He was obviously tired from fighting in the previous match, and it showed. The Franchise controlled the first third of the V.A. by Franchising Gateway and pinning him. Next Credible came out and he was also tired from the previous match. But he decided to even the odds by using an illegal object, that of a steel chair. So now Russ Rage appeared. Franchise was in control and hit an airplane spin slam and got the pin on Credible. Next came out Winner. He controlled the matchup with illegal weapons while Rage was not there to help because he was brawling with Credible. Franchise was about the give Winner a Franchiser but Credible hit Franchise with a steel chair. Winner picked Franchise up and gave him the Tiebreaker. He pinned Franchise so Franchise was fired!!!!!!!!!! JJ Clauson never did need to show up!! Franchise was fired!! Franchise was fired!! Of course Franchise and Rage were not happy and decided to take out Winner after the match. Rage and Franchise, The Eliminators, climbed onto of a table and threw Christopher Winner onto another table on the ground!!!!!!!!!!! Winner was out cold, but was still the victor as Franchise was fired. Oh My GOD!!!!
</p><p>
      Next was the Thumbtack Death Match. Christopher Winner was just taken out and now had to perform in an ECWF Title Match! Assman came out first and wanted the belt. Then a beaten Winner came out. Even though he was just beaten up, he would put up a good fight. The Franchise came out and announced that this was also a ladder match. Winner and Assman had a slober-knocker with not many technical moves by the big men. In one high spot, Assman and Winner each had a chair hit them together twice and Assman slammed Winner with a steel chair. Winner got up and poured the tacks on the steel chair. He went for a move on Assman but Assman reversed it and choke-slammed Winner on tacks!!!! He went to go get the belt but the Franchise told him to give Winner Death From Above so he did. On Tacks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Winner was dead and lost the title!!!!!!!!!!!!! What's gonna happen at Pandemonium!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!?!?!?!!!!!!</p>					</div><a name="pics"></a>
