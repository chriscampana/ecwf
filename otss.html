       <p>
The evening started off, with Dustin Credible giving us a rundown of the entire show. Our second pay-per-view was sure to be a spectacular one, and Credible would make a great impact on the show. He started by announcing his involvement along with the Assman in the Tag-Team Title Battle Royal. Next he spoke of the battle for the ECWF North American Championship between the extremely talented newcomer, and one fourth of the Victory Boyz, The Gateway and his newfound rival, The ECWF NA Champion Russ Rage. Credible also informed us of a match that he and the Assman would partake in, they would meet the winners of the battle royal for a shot at the belts. Then Dustin got to the Main Event between the former heavyweight champion of the world, Christopher Winner and his nemesis "The Whole F'n Show", The Franchise with the Franchise's ECWF World Championship strap on the line. This would truly turn out to be a historic night!  
 </p><p>
 As soon as Credible ended his rundown we were sent to a camera outside the ECWF Arena to the Parking area. We saw a white luxury automobile with a "Winner Wagon" sign on the hood; this could only mean one thing Winner and his Victory Boyz were there. Winner, Gateway and Casey Tibbs all got out of the Winner Wagon but Credible brought up a very good point, one half of T Squared, T-Bone was missing. Only moments after the Winner Wagon arrived the World Heavyweight Champion and his best friend Russ Rage pulled up ready for the night's card. 
 </p><p>
The nights true action opened up with the Victory Boyz led by Winner came to the ring. Christopher grabbed the microphone and started address the fans in Fulton County, Ga. Chris explained that T-Bone wouldn't be wrestling due to injury but guaranteed Casey Tibbs would win the Tag Team Belts by himself. Winner also went on to guarantee a Gateway victory as well as guaran- damn- teeing that he would win the ECWF strap. Winner was going to say more until he was interrupted by " NO Chance in Hell" which could only mean one thing, Commissioner Clawson was BACK!!!! 
Clawson started by saying he never gave Winner control. His first order of business after his long awaited return was to but Winner in a warm up match against Dustin Credible, he also announced that he would be the special guest referee for the World Title match, keeping the ECWF's reputation alive as the kings of the stipulation match!!!! Oh my God what a night this promises to be.  
 </p><p>
The first match would be Winner vs. Credible. Everyone was worried considering Winner is a former World champion and Dustin is just an announcer. The match started off with Dustin and Winner getting right in each others faces. Credible actually knocked the self proclaimed "only true winner" down! Winner got up and went to hit Credible, but barely touched him with two fingers and Credible went down!!! They had planned this all along! Winner got the three count and Credible had just joined the Victory Boyz!! Before they could celebrate The Franchise ran to the ring and canned every one with his Singapore cane. The camera cut backstage with the Assman confronting Credible about his turn. Credible told A-man not to worry, he can trust him.  
 </p><p>
The next match would be the Tag Battle royal. The participants were Casey Tibbs alone, Credible and Assman, Winner and Gateway, and The Franchise with Rage. This match was long and a tough battle with the only man standing at the end, Casey Tibbs! Tibbs had just one the tag belts for T Squared by himself. Immediately after his amazing victory Tibbs was forced to defend his titles, alone, against Dustin and the Assman. This match was a tough fight with a dazzling array of moves displayed by Tibbs and Credible. Assman used his incredible strength advantage, and choke-slammed Tibbs. He was going for the cover but Dustin pleaded with him to tag him in. Credible climbed to the second rung of the ladder and Centon Bombed Tibbs to get the 1, 2, 3. After the match Assman came in the ring to celebrate with Credible but when he turned his back, Credible low blow'd him! Credible has gone complete Victory Boy! What Dustin Credible did next was truly, well, INCREDIBLE! He climbed the 9 foot ladder to the very top and performed an amazing, beautiful Centon Bomb onto the Assman! This gave Credible the title of, The Insane Luchador!!!!!!!!!!!! Fans we are not lying. He actually jumped off an 9 foot ladder into a Centon Bomb!!!!  
 </p><p>
The next match was between Russ Rage and Gateway. Rage tried to use a fire extinguisher in the beginning but it hadn't been used in a long time and proved to be faulty. The action started with a collar to elbow tie up followed by a Gateway clothesline. Many weapons were used and Gateway seemed to have the upper hand. He climbed the ladder and gave Russ the Jersey Driver elbow slam. While most mortal men would have been finished, this only seemed to make Russ snap into a psychotic blur of rage! He gave Gateway the off the rope demolisher and finished him with the Sexy Slam.  
 </p><p>
Now the Main event. Things got underway with Winner making his way to the ring. Next the world heavyweight champion made his way to the ring with commissioner Clawson right behind him. Clawson ripped the shirt off ECWF senior referee Ryan Nelson and put it on his own back since he would ref this match. The Franchise and Winner exchanged blows and slams with no one with a clear advantage. Winner hit The Whole F'n Show with all he had and The Franchise went down. Winner climbed the ladder and went for a splash but The Franchise stuck a foot up and hit Chris right smack dab in the jaw. Franchise climbed the ladder and executed a 5-star frog splash and covered Winner but only got the 2 count. Franchise placed a cookie sheet between his shoulder and Winner's jaw and gave Chris the Franchiser! The Franchise grabbed his Singapore cane and went to hit winner, but Clawson stopped him and asked for the honors. Franchise obliged and gave him the cane. Clawson motioned toward Winner but then gave the Franchise a brutal cane shot to the back of the head! Winner and Clawson were in cahoots! Winner picked The Franchise up and executed his "Tie-Breaker" Clawson made the quick count and the new ECWF World Heavy Weight Champion was crowned! Christopher Winner!!!! YES!! or NO?!!!
