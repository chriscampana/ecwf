  This show started out with Dustin Credible reviewing the card. Because Victor E. Moore was suspended by the ECWF Executive committee Credible was out of a match. The Executive committee decided to make a triple threat match for the ECWF North American Title. It was the champion Assman versus Russ Rage versus Dustin Credible. This was an elimination Triple Threat Match. Russ Rage was mad and wanted the title and the match started off with him on offense. Then the Assman was about to pedigree Credible but Rage came in and there was a double pedigree on Credible. The match continued on when Credible low blow'd the other two superstars. Credible got up on the ladder and executed a Centon Bomb on Assman for the pin. Rage and Credible were the only two left. While Credible was performing his move, Rage was getting his breath back. Right after the Centon Bomb, Rage came in and gave Credible the Sexy Slam for the 1, 2, 3, and there is a new ECWF North American Champion.
</p><p>Now it was time for the much anticipated Table Death Match 2000. This was for the ECWF Heavyweight Title between champion Christopher Winner and The Franchise Jake Humphrey. This was a match for the ages with both superstars performing some of there signature moves. Winner snap suplexed Humphrey and was about to put him on the table but Humphrey evened the score with an eye gouge. He then proceeded to do a deadly power-bomb onto Winner. While Humphrey showed off to the camera Winner hit him with a deadly low blow. Winner put Humphrey on the table and climbed the ladder. When Winner was on top of the ladder, Humphrey regained his strength and pushed the ladder off from under him. Humphrey put Winner on the table, climbed the ladder, and executed the five star frog splash on Winner through the table. He was the new ECWF Heavyweight Champion. After the match Russ Rage came in and started beating on Winner. He declared a new era in the ECWF. The Rage-Franchise era. It is positive that Rage and Franchise have all the gold in the ECWF.</p>

   <p>
The evening started off, with Dustin Credible giving us a rundown of the entire show. Our second pay-per-view was sure to be a spectacular one, and Credible would make a great impact on the show. He started by announcing his involvement along with the Assman in the Tag-Team Title Battle Royal. Next he spoke of the battle for the ECWF North American Championship between the extremely talented newcomer, and one fourth of the Victory Boyz, The Gateway and his newfound rival, The ECWF NA Champion Russ Rage. Credible also informed us of a match that he and the Assman would partake in, they would meet the winners of the battle royal for a shot at the belts. Then Dustin got to the Main Event between the former heavyweight champion of the world, Christopher Winner and his nemesis "The Whole F'n Show", The Franchise with the Franchise's ECWF World Championship strap on the line. This would truly turn out to be a historic night!  
 </p><p>
 As soon as Credible ended his rundown we were sent to a camera outside the ECWF Arena to the Parking area. We saw a white luxury automobile with a "Winner Wagon" sign on the hood; this could only mean one thing Winner and his Victory Boyz were there. Winner, Gateway and Casey Tibbs all got out of the Winner Wagon but Credible brought up a very good point, one half of T Squared, T-Bone was missing. Only moments after the Winner Wagon arrived the World Heavyweight Champion and his best friend Russ Rage pulled up ready for the night's card. 
 </p><p>
The nights true action opened up with the Victory Boyz led by Winner came to the ring. Christopher grabbed the microphone and started address the fans in Fulton County, Ga. Chris explained that T-Bone wouldn't be wrestling due to injury but guaranteed Casey Tibbs would win the Tag Team Belts by himself. Winner also went on to guarantee a Gateway victory as well as guaran- damn- teeing that he would win the ECWF strap. Winner was going to say more until he was interrupted by " NO Chance in Hell" which could only mean one thing, Commissioner Clawson was BACK!!!! 
Clawson started by saying he never gave Winner control. His first order of business after his long awaited return was to but Winner in a warm up match against Dustin Credible, he also announced that he would be the special guest referee for the World Title match, keeping the ECWF's reputation alive as the kings of the stipulation match!!!! Oh my God what a night this promises to be.  
 </p><p>
The first match would be Winner vs. Credible. Everyone was worried considering Winner is a former World champion and Dustin is just an announcer. The match started off with Dustin and Winner getting right in each others faces. Credible actually knocked the self proclaimed "only true winner" down! Winner got up and went to hit Credible, but barely touched him with two fingers and Credible went down!!! They had planned this all along! Winner got the three count and Credible had just joined the Victory Boyz!! Before they could celebrate The Franchise ran to the ring and canned every one with his Singapore cane. The camera cut backstage with the Assman confronting Credible about his turn. Credible told A-man not to worry, he can trust him.  
 </p><p>
The next match would be the Tag Battle royal. The participants were Casey Tibbs alone, Credible and Assman, Winner and Gateway, and The Franchise with Rage. This match was long and a tough battle with the only man standing at the end, Casey Tibbs! Tibbs had just one the tag belts for T Squared by himself. Immediately after his amazing victory Tibbs was forced to defend his titles, alone, against Dustin and the Assman. This match was a tough fight with a dazzling array of moves displayed by Tibbs and Credible. Assman used his incredible strength advantage, and choke-slammed Tibbs. He was going for the cover but Dustin pleaded with him to tag him in. Credible climbed to the second rung of the ladder and Centon Bombed Tibbs to get the 1, 2, 3. After the match Assman came in the ring to celebrate with Credible but when he turned his back, Credible low blow'd him! Credible has gone complete Victory Boy! What Dustin Credible did next was truly, well, INCREDIBLE! He climbed the 9 foot ladder to the very top and performed an amazing, beautiful Centon Bomb onto the Assman! This gave Credible the title of, The Insane Luchador!!!!!!!!!!!! Fans we are not lying. He actually jumped off an 9 foot ladder into a Centon Bomb!!!!  
 </p><p>
The next match was between Russ Rage and Gateway. Rage tried to use a fire extinguisher in the beginning but it hadn't been used in a long time and proved to be faulty. The action started with a collar to elbow tie up followed by a Gateway clothesline. Many weapons were used and Gateway seemed to have the upper hand. He climbed the ladder and gave Russ the Jersey Driver elbow slam. While most mortal men would have been finished, this only seemed to make Russ snap into a psychotic blur of rage! He gave Gateway the off the rope demolisher and finished him with the Sexy Slam.  
 </p><p>
Now the Main event. Things got underway with Winner making his way to the ring. Next the world heavyweight champion made his way to the ring with commissioner Clawson right behind him. Clawson ripped the shirt off ECWF senior referee Ryan Nelson and put it on his own back since he would ref this match. The Franchise and Winner exchanged blows and slams with no one with a clear advantage. Winner hit The Whole F'n Show with all he had and The Franchise went down. Winner climbed the ladder and went for a splash but The Franchise stuck a foot up and hit Chris right smack dab in the jaw. Franchise climbed the ladder and executed a 5-star frog splash and covered Winner but only got the 2 count. Franchise placed a cookie sheet between his shoulder and Winner's jaw and gave Chris the Franchiser! The Franchise grabbed his Singapore cane and went to hit winner, but Clawson stopped him and asked for the honors. Franchise obliged and gave him the cane. Clawson motioned toward Winner but then gave the Franchise a brutal cane shot to the back of the head! Winner and Clawson were in cahoots! Winner picked The Franchise up and executed his "Tie-Breaker" Clawson made the quick count and the new ECWF World Heavy Weight Champion was crowned! Christopher Winner!!!! YES!! or NO?!!!

    <p>  This was the ECWF's third PPV and looked to be a good one. Dustin Credible, the Tag Me Champion and also ECWF announcer came out and announced the card. There would be of course the four way dance for the ECWF North American Title. This came as a result of T-Bone being kicked out of the ECWF. Next would be the Gauntlet Match with everyone in the Victory Alliance going in against The Franchise. If Franchise pinned all the wrestlers in the Victory Alliance, then he would get a chance to wrestle The Commish, JJ Clauson. If he pinned Clauson then he would control the ECWF for 90 days. If anyone in the Victory Alliance pinned The Franchise, then he would be fired from the ECWF. The last match would be the Thumbtack Death match for the ECWF Title between Assman and Winner. Here comes the first match. 
</p><p>
      The order of appearance for the match was Credible, Gateway, Tibbs, then Russ Rage. The Victory Alliance had stacked the deck in this match against Rage, because if they won the match then they would hold all the belts of the ECWF. The match started off with Gateway and Tibbs fighting as both of them wanted the North American gold, even though they were both members of the Victory Alliance. Rage stood back and let them fight to save his energy for later, as he would need it. Finally Dustin Credible hit the Centon-Credibomb on Gateway for the 1, 2, 3 and now there were three fighters. All three were fighting and all the sudden Russ Rage hit the patented Sexy Slam for the 1, 2, 3 on Credible. Tibbs saw an opening and struck as he Clotheslined Rage threw a ladder. Rage was out and Tibbs covered and won the ECWF North American Champion. The Victory Alliance came out to what appeared to be a celebration but they attack Casey Tibbs!!! Casey Tibbs, The Champ, was down and out. Why would the Victory Alliance kick him out of the Alliance if he had just won the NA Title?
</p><p>
      The next match was the Gauntlet Match. What was weird about the start of this match was there was still no appearance by The Commish. Did he plan on not even being there? Gateway came out first for the V.A. He was obviously tired from fighting in the previous match, and it showed. The Franchise controlled the first third of the V.A. by Franchising Gateway and pinning him. Next Credible came out and he was also tired from the previous match. But he decided to even the odds by using an illegal object, that of a steel chair. So now Russ Rage appeared. Franchise was in control and hit an airplane spin slam and got the pin on Credible. Next came out Winner. He controlled the matchup with illegal weapons while Rage was not there to help because he was brawling with Credible. Franchise was about the give Winner a Franchiser but Credible hit Franchise with a steel chair. Winner picked Franchise up and gave him the Tiebreaker. He pinned Franchise so Franchise was fired!!!!!!!!!! JJ Clauson never did need to show up!! Franchise was fired!! Franchise was fired!! Of course Franchise and Rage were not happy and decided to take out Winner after the match. Rage and Franchise, The Eliminators, climbed onto of a table and threw Christopher Winner onto another table on the ground!!!!!!!!!!! Winner was out cold, but was still the victor as Franchise was fired. Oh My GOD!!!!
</p><p>
      Next was the Thumbtack Death Match. Christopher Winner was just taken out and now had to perform in an ECWF Title Match! Assman came out first and wanted the belt. Then a beaten Winner came out. Even though he was just beaten up, he would put up a good fight. The Franchise came out and announced that this was also a ladder match. Winner and Assman had a slober-knocker with not many technical moves by the big men. In one high spot, Assman and Winner each had a chair hit them together twice and Assman slammed Winner with a steel chair. Winner got up and poured the tacks on the steel chair. He went for a move on Assman but Assman reversed it and choke-slammed Winner on tacks!!!! He went to go get the belt but the Franchise told him to give Winner Death From Above so he did. On Tacks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Winner was dead and lost the title!!!!!!!!!!!!! What's gonna happen at Pandemonium!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!?!?!?!!!!!!</p>

This was one of the greatest PPVs in ECWF history and the first PPV on the new ring. Because White Trash Dudley was a no-show then Russ Rage would be fighting the Garbage Man and Casey Tibbs would have Dustin Credible in a singles match for ECWF North American Title. The show started with Christopher Winner, JJ Cluason, and Dustin Credible sitting in their locker room. Gateway was not there because of injury. Clausoon had just gotten back from his tour of South East Africa, where they love the ECWF. He was very surprised and angry to learn that Christopher Winner had given The Franchise another chance in the ECWF. JJ then said how he gave Credible a shot at the North American belt which displeased Winner, as he wanted all the spotlight. 
</p><p>
The next segment featured an in-ring interview with the Victory Alliance. They reviewed the card and said how the Alliance will have all the gold in the ECWF, even the world title match, which a mystery person chosen by the Victory Alliance. Then on to the fist match.
</p><p>
The first match was The Garbage Man vs. former ECWF NA Title holder Russ Rage. Russ Rage hit the Off The Rope Demolisher for the first time off ropes!!! He controlled most of their match until The Garbage Man called for the garbage can. But Rage blocked the can and hit the Sexy Slam for the 1, 2, 3 and sort of an easy win for Rage in The Garbage Man's comeback.
</p><p>
The next match was for the ECWF North American Title. It had The Champ Casey Tibbs vs. Dustin Credible. In the beginning of this match we had the debut of the North American Title Trophy, not a belt. The match started off rough with Casey Tibbs using close fisted punches to get Credible off his feet. All of the sudden Credible went for a Centon-Credibomb which Tibbs moved out of the way. Soon after that, Tibbs went for a Hurricanrana but Credible blocked it and locked Tibbs in the Lion-Tamer where Tibbs was forced to submit. Credible was the new ECWF North American Title Trophy holder!!!!!
</p><p>
The third match was still a mystery to everyone. Who would Assman be fighting? We would soon know as Assman came out to his PERMANENT theme music, Assman by James Johnston. Soon we heard a loud "yee, haw." What was this? Then we saw. Not from the entrance way but from the woods came none other than Victor E. Moore!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one put it together but Victor E. had to be part of the Victor-y Alliance. So the match started with a much pumped Victor E. destroying Assman. But Assman's experience soon took over as he hit Moore with a choke-slam. He then went for an off the rope move but was hit in the back with a chair by Chris Winner!!!!! Moore gave Assman the Arabian RibBuster but Assman kicked out. Assman then hit his finisher, the implant DDT, and Moore was out. Credible and Winner came in to help out Moore but the mood turned quickly sour as the Victory Alliance took apart Moore for not winning the belt for the Victory Alliance. This was a shame.
</p><p>
The main event of the day was Christopher Winner vs. The Franhise for Franchise's contract in the ECWF. JJ Clauson hated the Franchise and wanted him out of the ECWF so he would obviously interfere in this match. Winner came out with the contract and burned it to imply of the "firing" of The Franchise. This match started off physical with The Franchise hitting many offensive moves. Then Winner locked a sleeper on The Franchise and it looked like he was out but Franchise got back up. Then Franchise hit the Triple Diamond, in which he hits two suplexes and a facebuster. Winner low blow'd the Franchise and brought him to the roper where The Commish threw a blinding liquid in the face of the Franchise!!! Winner the hit the Winner Slam but Franchise kicked out!!!!!!!!!!!! Winner brought him to get another dose of the liquid but Franchise moved and it hit Winner!!!!!! Winner was temporarily blinded and grabbed the first body he felt which was JJ Clauson!!!! He threw Clauson into the ring. There JJ tried to tell Winner it was him but Winner Winner-Slammed Clauson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then The Franchise gave Winner the Franchiser and locked him in the Crippler Crossface!!! Winner would not give up and eventually passed out due to the pain. Franchise has won!!!!!!!! He was back in the ECWF!!!!!!!!!! Back in the ring, a new Alliance was starting as The Franchise, Victor E. Moore, Russ Rage, and Casey Tibbs all destroyed the Victory Alliance. Winner received a Sexy Slam, Arabian RibBuster and another Franchiser. Oh my GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>This PPV started off strange. Chris Winner was shown preparing for his match with the Franchise when Dustin Credible came up to him. Now Dustin Credible and JJ Clauson have been on thin ice with Winner, and Credible told Winner that Clauson was not here. Winner thought it was great but then JJ called Credible's cell phone. JJ told Credible that the match between JJ and Assman for the World Tit</p><p>le was now going to be between Credible and Assman. Winner was steaming because he wanted the title shot. He told Clauson "screw you."

Now the first match was for that belt between Assman and Credible. Credible was already the NA Champ and now going for the World Belt. They came out swingin' and Credible went for a Centon-Credibomb to start the match. Assman got up and hit Credible with a chain link chain. Then Assman smacked Credible with a chair shot from hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was crazy! Nevertheless, Credible was down but not out. Assman went for the Death From Above but Credible reversed it into a crazy DDT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He locked Assman into the Canadian Maple Leaf and Assman passed out!! We had a new champion!!!! After that, Winner came into congratulate Credible and then promptly staple gunned his forehead, busting him open!!!!!!!!!!!! What's going on in the Victory Alliance???
</p><p>
Credible denounced the NA trophy so now Gateway vs. Tibbs would be fighting for it. T-Bone came out with his partner, Casey Tibbs, while Winner came out with Gateway. This match was a slober-knocker, until finally Tibbs hit the Triple LegDrop. When he went for the pin he got to a two count and T-Bone interuppted the pinfall!!!!!!!!!! He turned on Tibbs!!! Gateway got up and gave Tibbs the Jersey Driver to win his first title, the NA Title!! Then Winner hit Gateway. Winner and T-Bone were a team!!! They had this all planned!!!! Oh my God!!!
</p><p>
Now the interviewer explained what just happened but was hit in the back of the head by Winner, who explained that he and T-Bone are two parts of a trio that will take the ECWF by storm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who is the third person?????
</p><p>
The next match was singles in T-Bone with Winner vs. White Trash Dudley, who had just explained to the world that his real name is Lord Studley Dudley, and that he is from England and related to Prince Charles. On top of that, the Assman came and said that is is LSD's brother, "Gary Big Hands Dudley." He must have been still dazed from that beathing by Credible. Anyways in the match T-Bone used help from Winner to get the upper hand on Dudley. But Assman--er, Gary Big Hands Dudley, helped LSD. Winner tried to help T-Bone but GBHD gave Winner the Death From Above and the Dudleys gave T-Bone a 3D for the win. 
</p><p>
The next match was for the tag titles since T Squared were no longer champs. It was a three way match with the Dudleys vs. Gateway and Tibbs vs. Winner and T-Bone. All six men were in the ring at one time for most of the match. Finally GBHD locked Winner in FATTMISSION and would not let up. When he finally did, Winner beat him down. GBHD mustered up enough energy and and hit the Death From Above, but Winner feel on top of him and got the pin so T-Bone and Winner were tag champs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After the match Tibbs and Gateway stole the titles. 
</p><p>
The main event was Winner vs. The Franchise. It started off with a test of strength with Winner first getting the upper hand but Franchise came back. Winner then tried to call time out and when Franchise went for him he received an eye gouge from Winner. Then Winner hit the Buff Blockbuster on Franchise. Franchise got back up and gave him the Simon series, a series of two suplexes and a facebuster. Winner then but Franchise in a sleeper that he got out of. Winner started working on the right leg. He elbowed the knee many times of Franchise. Then he gave Franchise Enziguri and both men were down from exhaustion. They got up and Winner recieved a Franchiser but kicked out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Winner went for the Tiebreaker but Franchise kicked out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Winner then did a Winner Slam and fell on top for the 1, 2, 3 win. </p>

<p>The first match of the card was the Tag Team Battle Royal with the current champs being T-Bone and Chris Winner. They won. </p>

<p>Now it was on to the former friends T-Bone vs. Tibbs. The match started off with a shoving match, when suddenly Tibbs gained the upper hand with viscous punches to the face. Tibbs body slammed T-Bone and tried for the leg drop to end the match quickly. T-bone would not go down that quickly though. When he realized what was happening he quickly rolled out of the way, then jumped to his feet and quickly took advantage. Delivering multiple kicks to the ribs, and went for his move the Elbow Drop and since no one no it was his move Tony Shiavone showed up with a chorus of "That's his move!!!!" But T-bone didn't go for the pin; instead he climbed to the top of the ladder, and then took a leap of faith, as he went for a big splash. Unfortunately for T-bone, Tibbs managed to roll out of the way, he then delivered the leg drop for the 1,2,3.</p>

<p>The Assman vs. Commissioner JJ Clauson
(If Assman wins he is commissioner for whoooooo 90 days.)</p>
<p>Assman wasted little time for JJ to hit the ring. As soon as the commissioner's music started to play, Assman quickly jumped out of the ring, and went after him. JJ was prepared though, just as Assman came in view of Clauson, JJ swung and cracked him over the head with a chair. Clauson tried to pick the big man up, but he couldn't lift him so he just kicked him while he was on the ground. Finally, Assman slowly started to come to, and as he did, JJ started to run towards the ring. As soon as Assman got up, he began to give chase. The moment JJ saw this, he began to run around and around the ring, with the Assman slowly catching up. Clauson made a critical mistake because he jumped back in the ring to try and mount some kind of offense. Assman rolled into the ring and ducked under blinding liquid and gained the 1,2,3, by giving him death from above. He becomes Commish for Whooooo 90 days! </p>

<p>Now Dustin Credible vs. The Franchise. This match was a tie. There will be a rematch.</p>

<p>The Fire Match was won by Chris Winner, but that PPV sucked, time for the new PPV Burnin' Down the House </p>

      <img src="images/posters/ewe2.jpg" alt="EWE" class="img-responsive center-block" />
       <p> The was the first PPV in a while and appropriately named "the first ever EWE event". The event happened mysteriously as Chris Winner only called the event to tell the EWE stars about his changes as commish. </p>
<p>
The show started with Lawrence O'Malley and the Canadian Dream Dusty Orth running down the show's schedule, even though they didn't even know who was going to appear. They talked about how Christopher Winner had obtained rights to the ECWF from JJ Clauson, the former commish, and that he had changed the name to EWE. Since all the titles had been stripped in November, there would be all new champions tonight. </p>
<p>
Next was Chris Winner interview time in front of the EWE banner. He had a new shirt that said Commish Chris Winner on the front and "oh yeah, you're fired" on the back. He said that since all the belts had been stripped there would be a battle royal for the World title tonight. Winner also said he had fired Russ Rage for biting off Winner's mom's ear!! Then Franchise came out and he didn't want Russ Rage fired. He challenged Winner to one on one match and if Winner wins, the Winner is commish, but if Franchise wins, then Russ Rage is reinstated into the EWE. Then Winner and Franchise brawled into the backstage area. </p>
<p>
The first match started right after LSD came out and talked. He said from now on his will be known as Lowly Southern Dudley, the most Southern man in EWE. It was fitting that he was fighting Victor E. Moore, another kid from the confederacy in EWE. The fought a long battle until LSD gave Moore the Dirty Southern Slap in which he licks his hand, reaches it down his pants, and slaps his opponent. Moore was out but LSD would not get off of Moore. LSD had snapped and the referee reversed the match and made Moore the winner. Now Moore is the number one contender for the North American title, which was being fought for next. </p>
<p>
The North American title match was Assman vs. Dustin Credible vs. Casey Tibbs. This was a long fought match. Assman went out first when he tapped out to the 7 seconds of glory by Casey Tibbs. The Credible did the Credibomb and Tibbs was out giving Credible the NA Title. </p>
<p>
The next match was Winner vs Franchise with the stipulations mentioned above. This was a long fought match but it was won when Winner used two low blows on Franchise then performed the Winner slam and won. Winner then stuffed pieces of Russ Rage's contract down Franchise's throat meaning Russ Rage was fired!!!</p>
<p>
The next match was the battle royal for the EWE World Title. The first man out was the mysterious Amigo Doz. He left as mysteriously as he came in. Who is this Amigo Doz. Where was his partner? Then LSD was eliminated by Victor E. Moore. Then Victor E was eliminated by Tibbs who was eliminated by Credible. The Assman came in and destroyed everyone. He came in wearing all leather on a harly davidson with rock music in the background. Winner and Franchise got him out and soon Franchise beat Winner to win the EWE belt. Now Franchise was EWE champion.</p>
